Here we have some minimal command-line nodejs that can be run to show
how to use armlet.

Input parameter handling is minimal and command options are lacking so
we can focus on how to set up and call the client.


* [analysis](https://github.com/ConsenSys/armlet/blob/master/example/analysis): Submit a JSON with Solidity source and EVM bytecode information to the MythOS and retrieve results
* [api-version](https://github.com/ConsenSys/armlet/blob/master/example/api-version): Retrieve Mythril Platform API version information. JSON is output.
* [openapi-spec]((https://github.com/ConsenSys/armlet/blob/master/example/api-version)): Retrieve the current Mythril Platform openapi specification. YAML is output

See folder "typescript" for some of these examples written in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
